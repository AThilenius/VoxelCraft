VoxelCraft
==========

This is the first "large" personal project I ever built. It's the start of a game engine written in C++, with an embedded Mono runtime for C#. There was a partially complete GUI stack with animations, material loading (with shader compilation hot-swapping) and a few other fun things. This codebase is however from very early in my programming career and is thus pretty rough around the edges.
